# Project

A course project will be a major component of your work.
This will require hands-on experience with HCI, while remaining open to different possibilities.

Because we assume you are new to HCI research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work.
Instead, the expectation is that you will do something interesting.
It is then up to you to define interesting according to what you want to accomplish in this project, while seeking appropriate feedback from staff.
For example, you might choose to:

- Design and implement a new piece of HCI technology.
- Design and execute an appropriately compelling study with HCI research implications.
- Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans.
- Replicate an existing study or technology.
- Execute a design or implementation effort in the context of an established research project.

Due to the size of this course offering and constraints on course time and resources,
we expect projects will generally be done in groups of four.
We will consider groups of three as needed,
but do not expect to allow groups of one or two projects.
Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and it is also important for the logistics of this course.

## Project Ideas

Some sample project ideas, gathered from faculty and researchers, will be made available here:

<p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkProjectProposalIdeas' /></p>

<!--
You can also use that discussion to identify potential project partners and to post your own ideas.
-->

## Project Deliverables

Project deliverables are defined in terms of a proposal, a pair of self-defined milestones, and a final report.

Proposal Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectProposal' />.

Milestone 1 Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectMilestone1' />.

Milestone 2 Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectMilestone2' />.

Final Report Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectReport' />.

<!-- Removed from Winter 2022 offering
a survey of recent related research,
Related Research: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectRelatedResearch' />.
-->

## Proposal

Your proposal will define your initial plan for this project.
You can and should update this plan based on feedback, progress, and findings.
The proposal therefore needs to demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project,
but your project is expected to evolve as appropriate and necessary.

You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project with research goals outside this course.
However, it is critical to define what you will specifically accomplish in the course project.
The course project must stand on its own even if drawn from a larger research context.

Proposals consist of a short document, prepared with feedback prior to the due date.
<!-- Removed from Winter 2022 offering
and a short in-class presentation. -->

### Proposal Document

Within the provided Google Doc, using the provided template,
prepare a 2 page document addressing the following points:

- _What makes the project interesting? What is the problem or research question?_

  What is the pain point you want to solve, the new capability you want to enable, or the research you want to explore?

- _What existing understanding of the problem has been developed?_

  For a research proposal, this will briefly cover the most important related work in the space you are exploring.

  For a design proposal, this will introduce existing solutions, why they fall short, and the potential opportunity.

  For a proposal based within a larger project outside the context of this course,
  this will also provide key context regarding that outside project.

- _What milestones will the group plan to accomplish?_

  There are two milestone reports in the quarter, one early and one late.
  These are opportunities for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.

  Explain what your group will plan to accomplish by each of these milestones.
  You will be asked to revisit these plans during those milestone reports.

- _What might the group explicitly decide to omit?_

  Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish everything.
  Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to ignore or defer in this course.
  This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.

Proposals are effectively a contract on what you aim to accomplish,
but they are also an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Please be appropriately candid and thoughtful so as to receive maximum benefit from feedback.

<!-- Removed from Winter 2022 offering
### Proposal Presentation

Prepare a presentation consisting of 3 to 4 slides. Each group will give a short in-class presentation.

This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same information as the document.
Our primary goal is feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.
-->

### Proposal Samples

Sample project proposals from prior offerings have been made available here:

<p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkProjectProposalSamples' /></p>

Note that prior proposals were based on different format guidance (i.e., a shorter page count)
and were paired with an in-class proposal presentation.
Be sure to engage with the new format in this offering.

### Proposal Early Feedback

Prepare your proposal in this shared Google Doc:

<p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkProjectProposalGoogleDoc' /></p>

The use of a shared Google Doc for proposal preparation is intended to support early feedback.
Feel free to use Google Doc comment functionality to tag staff and classmates with questions.
We will also encourage you to review and comment on each other's proposals.

We have also dedicated time for in-class proposal preparation and review
on <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateProjectInClassProposalFinalization' />.
We expect proposals will be nearly complete at this time, so as to receive maximum benefit from feedback.

### Proposal Submission

Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectProposal' />.

Submit your final proposal document in PDF format.

## Survey of Recent Related Research

A survey of recent related research serves to inform and help scope your intended contributions.
Reviewing related work can often slip until late in a course project sequence,
so this activity structures some early engagement with the literature.

### Survey Document

Identify at least 8 papers that can inform or are otherwise related to your group research project.
These should be recent papers (e.g., any CHI 2020 paper is obviously appropriate,
but you could also identify other recent or upcoming papers).

For each paper, prepare a short summary that includes:

- Citation information for the paper
- A link to the article
- One short paragraph summarizing the paper (i.e., not a copy of the abstract, your own summary of the paper)
- One short paragraph on how it can inform or otherwise be related to your research

Note that identifying such papers and preparing these summaries
does not necessarily require deep engagement with the full details of the papers
(e.g., as you would when reviewing a paper, directly building upon a paper,
or reading one of the assigned papers for deep in-class discussion).
Be sure you understand the papers at a level appropriate for discussing them as related research,
but prioritize identifying relevant papers over pre-maturely going in-depth on papers that may ultimately be less relevant.

Also note this intentionally is a group assignment.
We do not expect or require that everybody in your group will have read all of the papers you identify.

## Milestone Reports

Two milestone reports serve as a check on the trajectory of your project
and an opportunity for feedback and guidance from staff and classmates.
Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.

Milestone reports consist of a short document and a short in-class presentation.

### Milestone Document

Within the provided Google Doc, using the provided template,
prepare a 1 page document addressing the following points:

- What you have done for this milestone, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.
- What you will do before your next milestone, including any revisions based on your status or findings.
- Any areas where you could use advice or are blocked.

### Milestone Presentation

Within the provided Google Slides document, using the provided template,
prepare a 3 to 4 slide in-class presentation to support a class conversation about the state of your project.

This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates.
Your presentation should cover the same information as the document.
Our primary goal is feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.

Be sure to consider <CourseInformationLink linkName="linkAccessiblePresentations" anchorText="Guidance on Making Your Presentation Accessible" />.

### Milestone Submission

Milestone 1 Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectMilestone1' />.

Milestone 2 Due: <CourseInformationAssignmentDate assignmentDateName='assignmentDateDueProjectMilestone2' />.

Submit your milestone document and milestone presentation in PDF format.

- Milestone 1 document and presentation:

  <p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkSubmitProjectMilestone1' /></p>

- Milestone 2 document and presentation:

  <p><CourseInformationLink linkName='linkSubmitProjectMilestone2' /></p>

## Final Report

Prepare a final report that is 10 to 20 pages in length, excluding references.

Your final report should be presented in the same general structure as the papers you read this quarter:

- Introduction and Motivation
- Statement of Contributions
- Related Work
- Description / Methods / Results
- Discussion / Future Work / Conclusion

Write according to the content you have.
Be appropriately thorough and precise in your presentation, but do not needlessly pad your text.

Format your report according to the current single-column CHI format:
