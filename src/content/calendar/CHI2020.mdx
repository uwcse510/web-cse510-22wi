Many of us would have been at CHI 2020 this week,
and we encourage you to participate in remote activities being organized by various elements of the CHI community.
As part of such activities, and/or through your own searching,
also complete your group project's [Survey of Recent Related Research](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse510/20sp/assignments/project#survey-of-recent-related-research).

The course staff will be available to meet with project teams during class time.
Such meetings are optional, but could focus on identifying potentially relevant readings,
seeking guidance on how to think about a specific reading, or other project-related advising.
Sign up for the reserved meeting times here:
