These "vision" papers challenge a dominant pattern, propose going beyond mimicking prior technologies, or cast a vision of future technologies.
This is not an exhaustive set of such papers, just a set chosen to be interesting and appropriate.

<ul>
    {props.readings.map(readingCurrent => (
        <li key={readingCurrent.title}>
            <p><FormattedReading reading={readingCurrent}/></p>
        </li>
    ))}
</ul>

### Non-Standard Reading Format

Each student has two responsibilities:

- Organize into groups of 2 to briefly present one of the above vision papers. Sign up for a paper here:

  <p><CourseInformationLink linkName="linkVisionsOrganization" /></p>

  It is critical to remember most people will not have read the paper you are presenting.
  It is therefore your responsibility to explain the vision.
  One useful way of breaking down and explaining the vision might be to discuss these four points:

  - What was the status quo at the time the authors wrote this?
  - What was the author’s vision of future technologies?
  - How has this vision played out since this publication?
  - How might this vision continue to play out in the future?

  Submit your presentation as 3 to 4 slides in PDF, PPT, or PPTX format:

  <p><CourseInformationLink linkName="linkSubmitVisions" /></p>

  Be sure to consider guidance on [Making Your Presentation Accessible](http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/july-august-2017/making-your-presentation-accessible).

- Individually read at least one more of the above vision papers.

Because "As We May Think" was presented as part of the previous lecture, you may not present it. You may still choose to read it.

No reading report is assigned.
Reading a second paper benefits in-class discussion, helping you see these visions and explore them appropriately.
Because some of these papers are quite long, you can and should skim according to your needs.
